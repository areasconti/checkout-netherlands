# Campaign Cart — AI Rules

> Copy this file to your project root as `CLAUDE.md` (or your AI tool's equivalent rules file) to give your AI assistant the context it needs to work correctly with Campaign Cart templates.

---

## AI assistant — do these before writing any code

**If you are reading this file because a user asked you to set up or work on a campaign:**

1. **Copy this file to the project root as `CLAUDE.md`** so it is loaded automatically in future sessions:
   ```bash
   cp docs/campaign-page-kit-template-context.md CLAUDE.md
   ```
   If this file came from a GitHub URL, write it to `CLAUDE.md` in the working directory directly. Alternatively, re-running `campaign-init` with `--ai-context claude` writes this file automatically (pass `--keep-ai-context` to preserve hand edits). For **landing / presell** work, also open [pre-checkout-pages.md](https://github.com/NextCommerceCo/campaign-cart-starter-templates/blob/main/docs/pre-checkout-pages.md) (that guide does not ship inside this single file).

2. **Look up the current `sdk_version`** — do not guess or use a version from your training data. Read `_data/campaigns.json` from the [campaign-cart-starter-templates repo](https://github.com/NextCommerceCo/campaign-cart-starter-templates) and copy the exact `sdk_version` string from there. It changes with every SDK release.

3. **Fetch the commerce surface catalog** before touching any template-family commerce components. It documents the Liquid params for each family's partials (bundle selector, payment methods, bumps, upsells, receipt, etc.) and includes per-family `agentContract` blocks plus fixture specs for mapping CampaignSpec/API truth into starter frontmatter:
   - Human-readable: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NextCommerceCo/campaign-cart-starter-templates/main/docs/commerce-surface-catalog.md
   - Machine-readable: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NextCommerceCo/campaign-cart-starter-templates/main/docs/commerce-surface-catalog.json
   - Fixture specs: https://github.com/NextCommerceCo/campaign-cart-starter-templates/tree/main/docs/fixtures/campaign-specs

4. **Include `gtm_id` and `fb_pixel_id` keys on every `campaigns.json` entry** — set them intentionally:
   - **`""` (empty string)** — layout **does not** inject GTM / Meta snippets in these starter templates (`base.html` uses `{% if campaign.gtm_id != "" %}` / `{% if campaign.fb_pixel_id != "" %}`).
   - **Any non-empty value** (including placeholders like `"GTM-XXXXXXX"` or `"123456789012345"`) — in **non-`development`** builds, the **snippets still load** and hit GTM / Facebook with that ID. Placeholders are **not** the same as “off”; they are “on with dummy IDs.” Use real production IDs when you want tracking; use `""` when you want layout-driven tags disabled.
   - **Omitting the keys** — may behave like missing data depending on your CPK/Liquid defaults; **prefer explicit `""`** when disabling so behavior matches these templates.

Do not proceed with code generation until you have completed all four steps above.

## What this project is

A campaign funnel built with:
- **[next-campaign-page-kit](https://github.com/NextCommerceCo/next-campaign-page-kit)** — the build tool. Handles Liquid templating, per-campaign asset isolation, dev server, and CLI scripts.
- **[Campaign Cart SDK](https://developers.nextcommerce.com/docs/campaigns/campaign-cart/)** — the runtime. Loaded via CDN, drives all cart, checkout, upsell, and receipt behaviour through HTML attributes and meta tags.

---

## SDK 0.4.x campaign model

**One package, one base price — use Campaign Offers for tier pricing.**

- **One `packageId`** with a base price set in the Campaigns App
- **Campaign Offers** define tier discounts (e.g. buy 2 → 30% off, buy 3 → 50% off) — the SDK reads these automatically
- **Bundle selector** (`data-next-bundle-selector` + `data-next-bundle-card`) presents tiers; each card uses `data-next-bundle-items` with the same `packageId` at different quantities
- **Coupons / vouchers** layer on top of offer pricing without any template changes needed

This replaces the 0.3.x pattern of separate packages per tier + `data-next-cart-selector` swap mode. The bundle selector is offer-aware; the old swap selector is not. When you see `data-next-cart-selector` in older templates, treat it as legacy.

---

## Template family and commerce surface routing

When adapting designed HTML into a Campaign Cart funnel, choose the template family from cheap, durable signals:

1. Explicit user instruction.
2. CampaignSpec template fields, when present.
3. Export folder/file names.
4. Unique commerce structure.
5. Distinct checkout layout structure.
6. Class-name fingerprints.

Do **not** infer the whole template family from brand colors, product category, copy tone, or a shared primitive like `payment-methods.html`.

High confidence means `>= 0.85` in the commerce surface JSON catalog. If the family is below that threshold, or if two families plausibly fit, ask the user before wiring SDK components. This is faster and safer than burning tokens on uncertain inference. Example:

> I can map this checkout to `olympus` or `olympus-mv-two-step`. The ambiguity is tier cards plus MV variant slot behavior. Which family should I use before wiring SDK components?

Reference catalog: [commerce-surface-catalog.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NextCommerceCo/campaign-cart-starter-templates/main/docs/commerce-surface-catalog.md) and [commerce-surface-catalog.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NextCommerceCo/campaign-cart-starter-templates/main/docs/commerce-surface-catalog.json).

Current first-class families include `olympus`, `limos`, `demeter`, `olympus-mv-single-step`, `olympus-mv-two-step`, `shop-single-step`, and `shop-three-step`. This list should grow as the commerce surface library grows.

For each first-class family, read `families[family].agentContract` in the JSON catalog before patching checkout, upsell, or receipt frontmatter. Treat `sharedFrontmatterVocabulary` as the cross-family dictionary:

- `packages.*` values come from CampaignSpec page packages and Campaigns API package `ref_id`s.
- `shipping_methods.*` values come from CampaignSpec/API shipping method `ref_id`s and are checkout/cart behavior only.
- `bundles` and `variant_slots` define selector rows; prefer `quantity` plus `packages.main_package` over hand-written item JSON unless the spec needs custom item sets.
- `order_bump`, `upsell_offer`, and `upsell_bundle_tiers` must be removed or changed when the target campaign does not expose the referenced package/voucher.
- `receipt_summary` preserves SDK order-item template ids; do not rewrite receipt item templates when frontmatter can express the change.

The fixtures in `docs/fixtures/campaign-specs/` are examples, not live Campaigns App exports. Use their `sdk_hints.frontmatter` blocks to understand the mapping, then replace every numeric `ref_id` from the target CampaignSpec/API.

---

## Read the SDK docs first

Before making any changes that touch cart, checkout, upsells, or SDK wiring, read:

- **Official docs:** https://developers.nextcommerce.com/docs/campaigns/campaign-cart/
- **SDK source:** https://github.com/NextCommerceCo/campaign-cart

The docs are the source of truth for SDK behaviour. Do not invent `data-next-*` attribute names or values — only use what is documented.

## Pre-checkout pages (landing and presell)

Pre-checkout pages have **no checkout form, cart, or upsell UI**, but a **live** lander or presell should still align with the Campaign Cart stack (`config.js`, SDK loader, `next-*` meta tags, optional layout GTM/Pixel from `campaigns.json`) the same way checkout does — see [SDK configuration (config.js)](#sdk-configuration-configjs), [SDK meta tags](#sdk-meta-tags-set-in-basehtml-via-frontmatter), and [Optional GTM and Meta Pixel](#optional-gtm-and-meta-pixel-gtm_id-fb_pixel_id) below.

- **`landing/`** (starter) — **section showcase**: copy `_includes/` into your slug. **Cross-slug CTAs** use a root-relative checkout URL in `next_url`, not `campaign_link`.
- **`presell/`** — **ready-to-use article** in the **same campaign slug** as `checkout.html`; use **`campaign_link`** for the checkout CTA.
- **Tailwind** — CDN in dev; compile `tailwind.css` for production.

**Full guide:** [docs/pre-checkout-pages.md](./pre-checkout-pages.md) (clone this repo) — canonical copy on GitHub:  
<https://github.com/NextCommerceCo/campaign-cart-starter-templates/blob/main/docs/pre-checkout-pages.md>  
If you only copy this file into your project as `CLAUDE.md`, use the **GitHub** URL so the deep guide stays reachable.

---

## campaigns.json

Registers every campaign. The `campaign` object in Liquid templates comes from here.

```json
{
  "my-campaign": {
    "name": "My Campaign",
    "entry_url": "presell",
    "sdk_version": "0.4.18",
    "store_name": "Acme Store",
    "store_url": "https://acme.com",
    "store_phone": "1-800-555-0100",
    "store_phone_tel": "tel:+18005550100",
    "store_terms": "https://acme.com/terms",
    "store_privacy": "https://acme.com/privacy",
    "store_contact": "https://acme.com/contact",
    "store_returns": "https://acme.com/returns",
    "store_shipping": "https://acme.com/shipping",
    "gtm_id": "GTM-XXXXXXX",
    "fb_pixel_id": "123456789012345"
  }
}
```

The top-level key is the campaign slug. Add any additional key to a campaign entry and it becomes available as `{{ campaign.key }}` on every page in that campaign.

**`entry_url`** — optional. The page slug `npm run dev` opens in the browser (e.g. `"presell"`). Omit to use the kit default.

**`sdk_version`** — must be a **pinned semver string** from the starter reference (e.g. `"0.4.18"`), never `"latest"`. A wrong or stale version causes subtle Campaign Cart runtime behaviour with no obvious build error.

### Build environment (`environment`)

[next-campaign-page-kit](https://github.com/NextCommerceCo/campaign-page-kit) exposes `environment` in Liquid: `development` for `npm run dev`, `production` for `npm run build`. Override with `CPK_ENV` (e.g. `CPK_ENV=staging npm run build`). Use this to keep third-party scripts out of local previews.

### Optional GTM and Meta Pixel (`gtm_id`, `fb_pixel_id`)

These starter templates inject **Google Tag Manager** and **Meta Pixel** from each campaign’s `_layouts/base.html` when:

- `environment` is not `development`, and  
- `gtm_id` and/or `fb_pixel_id` are **non-empty strings** in `_data/campaigns.json` (checked with `{% if campaign.gtm_id != "" %}` / `{% if campaign.fb_pixel_id != "" %}`).

**Gotchas**

- **`""` disables layout injection** for that tag. **`"GTM-XXXXXXX"`** (or any other non-empty placeholder) **still injects** on staging/production builds — do not assume placeholders mean “no script.”
- **Liquid:** do not replace `!= ""` with a bare `{% if campaign.gtm_id %}` — in Liquid, an **empty string can be truthy**, so you could inject broken or unwanted snippets.

The layout snippet and SDK provider work together: layout injection initialises GTM/Pixel, the SDK provider forwards ecommerce events into it. Enable both — set `gtm_id` / `fb_pixel_id` in `campaigns.json` **and** enable the matching provider in `config.js`.

---

## Page frontmatter

Every `.html` page starts with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Page Title"
page_layout: base.html               # optional — defaults to base.html; set to use a named layout
page_type: checkout          # checkout | upsell | receipt | product
next_url: upsell.html        # checkout pages: where to go after order
next_url: up02.html        # upsell pages: accept destination
decline_url: receipt.html    # upsell pages: decline destination
styles:
  - css/checkout.css
  - https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swiper@11/swiper-bundle.min.css
scripts:
  - https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swiper@11/swiper-bundle.min.js
  - js/checkout.js
---
```

- `page_layout` is optional — omit to use `base.html`. Set to a named layout file (e.g. `base-landing.html`) when a slug contains pages that need different layout stacks side by side, such as a landing page alongside checkout pages.
- `page_type` is required — it tells the SDK how to behave on this page
- `next_url` is required on checkout pages
- `next_url` / `decline_url` are required on upsell pages
- `styles` / `scripts` are page-specific; `next-core.css` and `config.js` are loaded by `base.html` for every page

---

## Liquid template filters

Always use these filters — never hardcode asset paths or page URLs.

### `campaign_asset`
Resolves to the campaign-relative path. Use for all local assets.

```liquid
<script src="{{ 'config.js' | campaign_asset }}"></script>
<link href="{{ 'css/checkout.css' | campaign_asset }}" rel="stylesheet">
<img src="{{ 'images/logo.png' | campaign_asset }}" alt="Logo">
```

### `campaign_link`
Generates a clean URL for inter-page navigation. Strips `.html`, adds trailing slash, prepends slug.

```liquid
<a href="{{ 'checkout.html' | campaign_link }}">Go to Checkout</a>
<meta name="next-success-url" content="{{ next_url | campaign_link }}">
```

### `campaign_include`
Includes a file from the campaign's `_includes/` directory.

**Do not use standard Liquid `{% include %}` — it looks in `src/` root and will fail with an ENOENT error. Always use `{% campaign_include %}`.**

**Parameter syntax:** Use `=` (equals), not `:` (colon). Params are passed as `key='value'` or `key=variable`.

```liquid
{% campaign_include 'testimonials.html' %}
{% campaign_include 'checkout-header.html' %}
{% campaign_include 'slider.html' images=slider_images %}
```

### Common Liquid variables

| Variable | Source |
|----------|--------|
| `{{ campaign.name }}` | campaigns.json |
| `{{ campaign.entry_url }}` | campaigns.json (optional) |
| `{{ campaign.sdk_version }}` | campaigns.json |
| `{{ campaign.store_name }}` | campaigns.json |
| `{{ campaign.store_phone }}` | campaigns.json |
| `{{ campaign.store_phone_tel }}` | campaigns.json |
| `{{ campaign.store_terms }}` | campaigns.json |
| `{{ campaign.store_privacy }}` | campaigns.json |
| `{{ campaign.store_contact }}` | campaigns.json |
| `{{ campaign.store_returns }}` | campaigns.json |
| `{{ campaign.store_shipping }}` | campaigns.json |
| `{{ campaign.gtm_id }}` | campaigns.json (optional) |
| `{{ campaign.fb_pixel_id }}` | campaigns.json (optional) |
| `{{ environment }}` | kit: `development` / `production` (override with `CPK_ENV`) |
| `{{ title }}` | page frontmatter |
| `{{ page_type }}` | page frontmatter |
| `{{ next_url }}` | page frontmatter |
| `{{ next_url }}` | page frontmatter |
| `{{ decline_url }}` | page frontmatter |
| `{{ content }}` | injected by base.html only |

---

## base.html pattern

`base.html` is the layout shell. It is not a page — it wraps every page's `{{ content }}`.

It always:
- Loads `config.js` before the SDK
- Loads the Campaign Cart SDK from CDN using `{{ campaign.sdk_version }}`
- Loads `next-core.css` directly (not via frontmatter)
- Injects per-page `styles` and `scripts` from frontmatter
- Conditionally renders SDK meta tags only when the relevant frontmatter field is set
- In these starter templates: may inject GTM / Meta Pixel from `campaign.gtm_id` / `campaign.fb_pixel_id` when not in `development` (see above)

```html
{% if next_url %}<meta name="next-success-url" content="{{ next_url | campaign_link }}">{% endif %}
{% if next_url %}<meta name="next-upsell-accept-url" content="{{ next_url | campaign_link }}">{% endif %}
{% if decline_url %}<meta name="next-upsell-decline-url" content="{{ decline_url | campaign_link }}">{% endif %}
```

Do not modify `base.html` to add page-specific logic. Put page-specific content in the page file or a `_includes/` component.

---

## SDK configuration (config.js)

Lives at `assets/config.js`. Sets `window.nextConfig` before the SDK loads. The full structure:

```js
window.nextConfig = {
  // Required
  apiKey: 'your-api-key-here',

  currencyBehavior: 'auto', // 'auto' | 'manual'

  paymentConfig: {
    expressCheckout: {
      enabled: true,
      requireValidation: true,
      requiredFields: ['email', 'fname', 'lname'],
      methodOrder: ['paypal', 'apple_pay', 'google_pay']
    }
  },

  addressConfig: {
    // defaultCountry: 'US',             // Low-priority fallback when campaign list is empty
    // showCountries: ['US', 'CA', 'GB'], // Deprecated – campaign API provides countries; fallback only
    dontShowStates: ['AS', 'GU', 'PR', 'VI'], // state codes to hide
    // AUTOCOMPLETE PROVIDER:
    //   Option 1 (active): NextCommerce — enableAutocomplete: true, leave googleMaps.apiKey empty
    //   Option 2: Google Maps — fill in googleMaps.apiKey below; takes priority when apiKey is non-empty
    //   Option 3: Disabled — remove enableAutocomplete and leave googleMaps.apiKey empty
    enableAutocomplete: true,
  },

  // Google Maps API key — leave empty to use NextCommerce autocomplete (Option 1 above)
  googleMaps: {
    apiKey: '',
    region: 'US',
  },

  // Required for Facebook purchase deduplication
  storeName: 'your-store-name',

  analytics: {
    enabled: true,
    mode: 'auto', // 'auto' | 'manual' | 'disabled'
    providers: {
      nextCampaign: { enabled: true },
      gtm: { enabled: false, settings: { containerId: 'GTM-XXXXXX' } },
      facebook: { enabled: false, settings: { pixelId: 'YOUR_PIXEL_ID' } },
      rudderstack: { enabled: false, settings: {} },
      custom: { enabled: false, settings: { endpoint: 'https://...', apiKey: '...' } }
    }
  },

  utmTransfer: {
    enabled: true,
    applyToExternalLinks: false,
  },

  // Optional: discount codes
  // discounts: {
  //   SAVE10: { code: 'SAVE10', type: 'percentage', value: 10, scope: 'order' }
  // },

  // Optional: profiles for dynamic package mapping (e.g. exit intent pricing)
  // profiles: {
  //   SAVE_5: { name: 'Exit Save 5', packageMappings: { 1: 9, 2: 10 } }
  // },
};
```

Run `npm run config` to set the API key interactively. The API key comes from the Campaigns App in your store.

---

## SDK meta tags (set in base.html via frontmatter)

| Meta tag | Value | Set by |
|----------|-------|--------|
| `next-funnel` | `{{ campaign.name }}` | base.html always |
| `next-page-type` | `{{ page_type }}` | base.html always |
| `next-success-url` | `{{ next_url \| campaign_link }}` | base.html if frontmatter set |
| `next-upsell-accept-url` | `{{ next_url \| campaign_link }}` | base.html if frontmatter set |
| `next-upsell-decline-url` | `{{ decline_url \| campaign_link }}` | base.html if frontmatter set |

---

## SDK data attributes

The SDK is controlled entirely through HTML attributes. Do not write JavaScript to replicate what these attributes already do.

### Checkout form

```html
<form data-next-checkout="form">
  <input data-next-checkout-field="email" type="email">
  <input data-next-checkout-field="firstName" type="text">
  <input data-next-checkout-field="lastName" type="text">
  <input data-next-checkout-field="phone" type="tel">
  <!-- address fields -->
  <input data-next-checkout-field="address1" type="text">
  <input data-next-checkout-field="city" type="text">
  <select data-next-checkout-field="country"></select>
  <select data-next-checkout-field="province"></select>
  <input data-next-checkout-field="zip" type="text">
</form>
```

### Multi-step navigation

```html
<button data-next-checkout-step="{{ 'billing.html' | campaign_link }}">Continue</button>
```

### Dynamic display

```html
<span data-next-display="cart.total"></span>
<span data-next-display="cart.subtotal"></span>
<span data-next-display="cart.quantity"></span>
<span data-next-display="cart.savings"></span>
```

**SDK 0.4.x:** `data-next-display="cart.discountCode"` is **not** wired in the cart-summary display resolver (Known #10 / BS-014). Use `data-next-discounts="voucher"` + `{discount.description}` to show the code string, `{discount.name}` for the display label. For bundle-line and summary tokens, use the [Campaign Cart SDK docs](https://developers.nextcommerce.com/docs/campaigns/campaign-cart/) and bundle selector reference in the [campaign-cart](https://github.com/NextCommerceCo/campaign-cart) repo as needed.

### Bundle tier display (`data-next-bundle-display`)

Reads from the **active bundle selection**. Use inside `data-next-bundle-card` to show that card's tier values, or on the `data-next-bundle-selector` container to reflect the selected tier.

```html
<!-- On a bundle card — shows this card's tier values -->
<div data-next-bundle-card data-next-bundle-id="buy2" ...>
  Save <span data-next-bundle-display="discountPercentage">XX%</span> OFF
  <span data-next-bundle-display="total"></span>
</div>

<!-- Outside cards — reflects the currently selected tier -->
<span data-next-bundle-display="price"></span>
<span data-next-bundle-display="total"></span>
<span data-next-bundle-display="discountPercentage"></span>
```

`data-next-bundle-display` is separate from `data-next-display` — do not mix them. Allowed keys follow the SDK’s bundle display resolver — confirm against current [Campaign Cart](https://github.com/NextCommerceCo/campaign-cart) bundle/upsell enhancer docs rather than guessing paths.

### Conditional visibility

```html
<div data-next-show="cart.hasDiscounts">You save: <span data-next-display="cart.totalDiscount"></span></div>
<div data-next-hide="cart.isEmpty"><!-- shown when cart has items --></div>
```

### Cart item list

```html
<div data-next-cart-items></div>

<template id="cart-item-template">
  <div data-cart-item-id="{item.id}">
    <img src="{item.image}" alt="{item.name}">
    <div>{item.name}</div>
    <div>{item.quantity} x {item.unitPrice}</div>
    <div>{item.total}</div>
  </div>
</template>
```

Note: Inside `<template>` elements, tokens use single braces `{item.field}`, not Liquid `{{ }}`.

### Cart summary v2 (`data-next-cart-summary`)

Live summary panel — updates on tier change, coupon apply, and bump toggle. Use `data-summary-lines` for line rows; tokens use `{item.*}` (SDK 0.4.11+). **Do not use `{line.*}` legacy names — removed in 0.4.11, render silently blank.**

```html
<div data-next-cart-summary>
  <div data-summary-lines>
    <template>
      <div data-package-id="{item.packageId}">
        <span>{item.quantity}x {item.name}</span>
        <span class="{item.hasDiscount}">{item.originalUnitPrice}/ea</span> <!-- strikethrough -->
        <span>{item.unitPrice}/ea</span>
        <span class="{item.hasDiscount}">{item.originalPrice}</span> <!-- line total strikethrough -->
        <span>{item.price}</span> <!-- line total after discount -->
      </div>
    </template>
  </div>
  <div data-next-discounts="offer">
    <template><div>{discount.name}: −{discount.amount}</div></template>
  </div>
  <div data-next-discounts="voucher">
    <template><div>{discount.description}: −{discount.amount}</div></template>
  </div>
  <span data-next-display="cart.total"></span>
</div>
```

Key token semantics (0.4.11+): `{item.price}` / `{item.originalPrice}` = **line totals** (qty × price); `{item.unitPrice}` / `{item.originalUnitPrice}` = **per-unit**. `{item.hasDiscount}` returns `"show"` or `"hide"` as a CSS class value. Cross-check any additional `{item.*}` / `{line.*}` names against the SDK version you pin in `campaigns.json` — the [official docs](https://developers.nextcommerce.com/docs/campaigns/campaign-cart/) track supported summary tokens.

### Order bump

```html
<!-- data-next-await hides until SDK is ready -->
<div data-next-await="">
  <!-- data-next-bump: the toggle container
       data-next-package-id: package to add/remove when toggled
       data-next-package-sync: main package ID(s) — syncs bump quantity to match.
         0.4.x one-package model: typically a single ID (e.g. "123").
         Legacy multi-package model: comma-separated list per tier (e.g. "123,124,125"). -->
  <div data-next-bump=""
       data-next-package-id="456"
       data-next-package-sync="123"
       class="next-active">

    <!-- data-next-toggle="toggle": the clickable area that toggles the bump -->
    <div data-next-toggle="toggle" class="bump__header next-active">
      <div class="bump__checkbox">
        <!-- os-component="check" shown/hidden via CSS based on .next-active state on parent -->
        <div os-component="check" class="checkbox__icon">&#10003;</div>
      </div>
      <div class="bump__title">Yes, add the upgrade to my order</div>
    </div>

    <div class="bump__body">
      Only <span data-next-display="package.price" data-next-package-id="456"></span> — added now.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

CSS required for checkbox state (already in `checkout.css` — only add if using a custom stylesheet):
```css
[data-next-bump] [os-component="check"] { display: none; }
[data-next-bump][class*="next-active"] [os-component="check"] { display: flex; }
```

### Express checkout

```html
<div data-next-express-checkout="container"></div>
```

### Coupon

```html
<input data-next-coupon="input" type="text">
<button data-next-coupon="apply">Apply</button>
<div data-next-coupon="message"></div>
```

### Quantity controls

```html
<button data-next-quantity="decrease" data-next-package-id="123">-</button>
<span data-next-display="cart.quantity"></span>
<button data-next-quantity="increase" data-next-package-id="123">+</button>
```

### Bundle selector — primary 0.4.x pattern

One package, multiple quantity tiers. `data-next-bundle-items` is JSON: `packageId` (from Campaigns App) + `quantity`. Campaign Offers drive tier pricing automatically.

```html
<div data-next-bundle-selector data-next-selector-id="main" data-next-selection-mode="swap">
  <div data-next-bundle-card data-next-bundle-id="buy1"
       data-next-bundle-items='[{"packageId":1,"quantity":1}]'
       data-next-selected="true" role="button">
    <span>1x</span>
    <span data-next-bundle-display="total"></span>
  </div>
  <div data-next-bundle-card data-next-bundle-id="buy2"
       data-next-bundle-items='[{"packageId":1,"quantity":2}]'
       role="button">
    <span>2x</span>
    Save <span data-next-bundle-display="discountPercentage"></span>
    <span data-next-bundle-display="total"></span>
  </div>
  <div data-next-bundle-card data-next-bundle-id="buy3"
       data-next-bundle-items='[{"packageId":1,"quantity":3}]'
       role="button">
    <span>3x</span>
    <span data-next-bundle-display="total"></span>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Package swap selector (legacy / 0.3.x pattern)

Still functional but **not offer-aware** — tier pricing must be set per-package in the Campaigns App. Use bundle selector for new campaigns.

```html
<div data-next-cart-selector data-next-selection-mode="swap">
  <div data-next-selector-card data-next-package-id="123" data-next-selected="true">
    1 bottle — <span data-next-display="package.price" data-next-package-id="123"></span>
  </div>
  <div data-next-selector-card data-next-package-id="456">
    3 bottles — <span data-next-display="package.price" data-next-package-id="456"></span>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Per-card shipping (`data-next-shipping-id`)

Sets the shipping method when a card is selected. Works on both `data-next-selector-card` (swap mode) and `data-next-bundle-card` (SDK 0.4.12+). Value is the shipping method `ref_id` from the Campaigns App.

```html
<!-- Bundle cards — functional from SDK 0.4.12 -->
<div data-next-bundle-card data-next-bundle-id="buy1" data-next-shipping-id="SPEC_STANDARD_SHIPPING_REF" ...>1x — $5 shipping</div>
<div data-next-bundle-card data-next-bundle-id="buy3" data-next-shipping-id="SPEC_FREE_SHIPPING_REF" ...>3x — Free shipping</div>
```

All cards in a selector should have `data-next-shipping-id` if any do — cards without it will not change the active shipping method when selected.

Do not carry starter/demo shipping IDs between campaigns. `campaign-build` renders template frontmatter as-is; it does not validate a CampaignSpec or remap shipping refs. In starter templates that expose selector shipping, use `shipping_methods.standard` / `shipping_methods.free` in checkout frontmatter, replacing the starter refs with target Campaigns App shipping method `ref_id`s. If the target campaign does not have tier-specific shipping, leave those values blank or remove `shipping_method` from the bundle rows.

### Add to cart button

```html
<button data-next-action="add-to-cart" data-next-package-id="123" data-next-url="{{ 'checkout.html' | campaign_link }}">
  Buy Now
</button>
```

### State CSS classes (managed automatically by SDK)

| Class | Applied to |
|-------|-----------|
| `.next-selected` | selected selector card |
| `.next-in-cart` | item currently in cart |
| `.next-active` | active/enabled button |
| `.next-disabled` | disabled button |
| `.next-loading` | element in loading state |

---

## Cart summary partials

All templates ship three ready-to-use cart summary partials in `_includes/`. Swap by changing the `{% campaign_include %}` reference in `checkout.html`.

| Partial | Style | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| `cart-summary01.html` | Tabular, no accordion | Default for olympus. Clean item + totals list. |
| `cart-summary02.html` | Accordion / card | Default for limos. Includes `item.isRecurring` / `item.frequency` row. |
| `cart-summary03.html` | Tabular + feature block | Default for demeter. Cart heading + product image outside `<template>` — no flash on re-render. |

### `[data-next-cart-summary]` pattern

```html
<div data-next-cart-summary>
  <!-- Static chrome (heading, product image) here — not inside <template> -->
  <template>
    <!-- CartSummaryEnhancer tokens: {subtotal}, {shipping}, {total}, {discounts} -->
    <!-- data-summary-lines + inner <template> for cart item rows -->
  </template>
</div>
```

Elements outside `<template>` render immediately and update in-place via `data-next-display`. Elements inside are rebuilt on every cart change — avoid `data-next-show` / `data-next-hide` inside the template where possible; if needed, add `style="display:none"` on the element to prevent flash before SDK evaluation.

**`cart.currency` node:** always leave empty — the SDK fills it. A hardcoded `"USD"` literal flashes before being overwritten.

See the [Campaign Cart SDK documentation](https://developers.nextcommerce.com/docs/campaigns/campaign-cart/) for supported display paths, `data-next-format`, and cart-summary behavior (including avoiding flash on currency nodes).

---

## Swiper component (sw1)

`swiper-gallery.html` is a reusable component used across checkout and upsell layouts.

### Contract (do not break)

- JS init targets: `data-component="swiper"` + `data-variant="sw1"` together.
- Do not rename/change `data-variant` unless the same selector is updated everywhere Swiper is initialized.
- Required inner hooks remain: `[swiper="slider-main"]`, `[swiper="slider-thumbs"]`, `[swiper="prev-button"]`, `[swiper="next-button"]`.

### Default behavior

- Main and thumbs are square (`1 / 1`) by default.
- No params needed for legacy square galleries.

### Optional include params (CSS-only; JS unchanged)

- `swiper_aspect`: main stage ratio token (`landscape`, `16/9`, `16-9`, `3/2`, `3-2`, `4/3`, `4-3`)
- `swiper_thumb_aspect`: thumb ratio token (same values; omit to keep square thumbs)
- `swiper_fit`: `contain` (default for non-square) or `cover`

Unknown aspect tokens are normalized and ignored if unsupported (attribute omitted).

```liquid
{% campaign_include 'swiper-gallery.html'
  main_slides=swiper_slides
  thumbs=swiper_thumbs
  variant='sw1'
  swiper_aspect='16-9'
  swiper_fit='cover'
  swiper_thumb_aspect='16-9'
%}
```

---

## Upsell pages

Upsell pages use a different set of attributes than checkout pages.

### Accept / decline actions

```html
<button data-next-upsell-action="add">Yes, add this to my order</button>
<button data-next-upsell-action="skip">No thanks</button>
```

### Direct upsell offer (simple / no offer-aware pricing)

For single-package upsells without voucher-driven pricing. If the upsell uses Campaign Offers or per-tier vouchers, use the **Bundle upsell** pattern below instead.

```html
<div data-next-upsell="offer" data-next-package-id="789">
  <span data-next-display="package.name" data-next-package-id="789"></span>
  <span data-next-display="package.price" data-next-package-id="789"></span>
</div>
```

### Upsell quantity controls

```html
<button data-next-upsell-quantity="decrease">-</button>
<span data-next-upsell-quantity="display"></span>
<button data-next-upsell-quantity="increase">+</button>
```

### Display tokens on upsell pages

```html
<span data-next-display="package.name"></span>
<span data-next-display="package.price"></span>
<span data-next-display="package.hasSavings"></span>
<span data-next-display="package.savingsPercentage"></span>
```

### Bundle upsell (SDK 0.4.x) and MV external slots

- **Coupon/voucher-driven** upsell pricing uses **Approach B**: `data-next-bundle-selector` + `data-next-upsell-context`, `data-next-bundle-vouchers`, `data-next-upsell-action-for`. Contrast with simple single-package upsells in the [Upsells](https://developers.nextcommerce.com/docs/campaigns/upsells) documentation (bundle vs selection patterns).
- **References:** `limos/checkout.html` (checkout + native **bundleQuantity**, **`.checkout-bundle-offer`** + **`.next-bundle-qty--anchor-br`**, stepper **not** inside **`[data-next-bundle-card]`**); `olympus/upsell-bundle-stepper.html` (same **`.next-bundle-qty*`** stepper on upsell); `upsell-bundle-tier-pills.html` / `upsell-bundle-tier-cards.html` (tiered bundle tiers, same generic qty classes); **`olympus-mv-single-step/upsell-mv.html`** (tier pills + **`data-next-bundle-slots-for`** slot layout; checkout omits native checkout bundle qty — see **limos**). Styles: **`next-core.css`** (not upsell-only).
- **Variant UI in staged bundle slots:** SDK-injected **native `<select>`** works **without** extra JS. **`setupBundleSlotVariantDropdowns()`** (custom **`os-dropdown`** UI) is **opt-in** — see file-header comments in **`checkout-olympus-mv-full.js`** and **`upsells-mv.js`** on the **`olympus-mv-single-step`** template.

## npm scripts

Run from inside your project directory (where `package.json` is):

```bash
npm run dev              # interactive campaign picker + dev server
npm run build            # build all campaigns to _site/
npm run clone            # duplicate a campaign to a new slug
npm run config           # set API key for a campaign
npm run compress         # compress images in a campaign
npm run compress:preview # preview compression savings without writing files
npm run start            # interactive launcher (dev / compress / clone / config menu)
npm run migrate          # migrate campaigns.json from old array format to current key-based format
```

---

## Deploying your project

**1. Build**

```bash
npm run build
```

Outputs all campaigns to `_site/`. Before building, make sure `config.js` in each campaign has a real API key — not the placeholder set during development.

**2. Deploy `_site/`**

The build output is plain static HTML, CSS, and JS — no server runtime required. Deploy the `_site/` folder to any static host. Campaigns are served at:

```
https://your-domain.com/[slug]/checkout
https://your-domain.com/[slug]/upsell
https://your-domain.com/[slug]/receipt
```

| Host | How |
|------|-----|
| **Netlify** | Copy `netlify.toml` from [campaign-cart-starter-templates](https://github.com/NextCommerceCo/campaign-cart-starter-templates) into your project root — set `base` to your project folder, `command` to `npm run build`, `publish` to `_site`. Netlify will build and deploy on push. |
| **Vercel** | Set root directory to your project folder, build command to `npm run build`, output directory to `_site`. |
| **Cloudflare Pages** | Connect your repo, set build command to `npm run build`, output directory to `_site`. Deploys automatically on push. |
| **GitHub Pages** | Build locally with `npm run build`, then push the contents of `_site/` to your `gh-pages` branch. |
| **Any other host** | Upload or sync the `_site/` folder — it's plain static files. |

## Task checklists

Use these when implementing or verifying a specific task. Work through each item — do not skip.

### Configuring config.js for a new campaign

- [ ] `apiKey` set to the campaign's API key from the Campaigns App (`npm run config` or edit directly)
- [ ] `storeName` set — required for Facebook purchase deduplication
- [ ] `addressConfig.defaultCountry` set to the primary target market
- [ ] `paymentConfig.expressCheckout.enabled` — set `true` to show PayPal/Apple Pay/Google Pay buttons, `false` to hide
- [ ] `analytics.providers.gtm.enabled` — set `true` and add `containerId` to match the `gtm_id` in `campaigns.json`; the layout snippet loads GTM, the SDK provider forwards ecommerce events into it
- [ ] `analytics.providers.facebook.enabled` — set `true` and add `pixelId` to match the `fb_pixel_id` in `campaigns.json`; same two-part pattern as GTM
- [ ] Address autocomplete — choose one option: (1) NextCommerce: `addressConfig.enableAutocomplete: true`, leave `googleMaps.apiKey` empty. (2) Google Maps: set `googleMaps.apiKey`; Google Maps takes priority when non-empty. (3) Disabled: remove `enableAutocomplete` from `addressConfig` and leave `googleMaps.apiKey` empty.
- [ ] `discounts` block — uncomment and configure if the campaign uses promo codes, otherwise leave commented out
- [ ] `profiles` block — uncomment and configure if the campaign uses dynamic pricing (e.g. exit intent), otherwise leave commented out

### Setting up a new campaign from a template

- [ ] Entry exists in `_data/campaigns.json` with `slug`, `name`, `sdk_version`, and all `store_*` fields
- [ ] Optional: `gtm_id` / `fb_pixel_id` in campaigns.json — real container and pixel IDs for production; omit keys to disable layout-injected tags
- [ ] API key is set in `assets/config.js` (run `npm run config` or edit directly)
- [ ] All `data-next-package-id` values updated to real package IDs from the Campaigns App
- [ ] Exactly one selector card per selector group has `data-next-selected="true"`
- [ ] All `data-next-package-sync` values updated to the new main package IDs
- [ ] All pages have correct `page_type` in frontmatter
- [ ] Checkout page has `next_url` pointing to the first upsell (or receipt)
- [ ] Each upsell page has both `next_url` and `decline_url` set
- [ ] The final upsell's accept and decline both point to `receipt.html`
- [ ] All local asset paths use `campaign_asset`, not hardcoded relative paths
- [ ] All inter-page links use `campaign_link`, not hardcoded paths

### Adding an order bump

- [ ] Outer wrapper has `data-next-await=""` (hides until SDK ready)
- [ ] Toggle container has `data-next-bump=""` and `data-next-package-id` set to the bump package
- [ ] `data-next-package-sync` on the toggle container lists all main package IDs (if quantity should sync)
- [ ] Clickable header has `data-next-toggle="toggle"`
- [ ] `os-component="check"` element exists inside the header for the checkmark
- [ ] CSS for `[data-next-bump][class*="next-active"] [os-component="check"]` is present in the stylesheet
- [ ] Bump package ID exists as a real package in the Campaigns App

### Adding a new upsell step

- [ ] New page file created with `page_type: upsell`
- [ ] New page has `next_url` pointing to the next destination
- [ ] New page has `decline_url` — routing is intentional (skip to receipt, or show next upsell)
- [ ] `data-next-upsell="offer"` container has the correct `data-next-package-id`
- [ ] Both `data-next-upsell-action="add"` and `data-next-upsell-action="skip"` buttons are present
- [ ] Previous upsell page's `next_url` updated to point to the new page
- [ ] Previous upsell page's `decline_url` routing updated intentionally
- [ ] Progress bar / step indicator updated on affected pages (this is plain HTML, not SDK-driven)

### External bundle slots + variant dropdown (MV 0.4.x)

- [ ] **`data-next-bundle-slots-for`** and slot markup match the campaign’s bundle structure — see [Upsells](https://developers.nextcommerce.com/docs/campaigns/upsells) and the reference implementation **`olympus-mv-single-step/checkout.html`** in [campaign-cart-starter-templates](https://github.com/NextCommerceCo/campaign-cart-starter-templates)
- [ ] **Barebones path:** if native **`<select>`** styling is enough, do **not** call **`setupBundleSlotVariantDropdowns()`** (no custom dropdown JS required)
- [ ] **Custom dropdown path:** if you call **`setupBundleSlotVariantDropdowns()`** from **`checkout-olympus-mv-full.js`** / **`upsells-mv.js`**, keep **`initBundleQtyToggle()`** (or equivalent) in sync on upsell when using quantity toggles + Approach B
- [ ] **Per-tier vouchers** on bundle upsell cards exist in Campaigns and match **`data-next-bundle-vouchers`** on each **`data-next-bundle-card`**

### Configuring FOMO popups

- [ ] `initFomo()` is called inside the `next:initialized` event handler in the checkout JS file
- [ ] `items` array — if the default (campaign products) isn't right, supply a custom array with `{ text, image }` entries specific to this campaign's products/bundles
- [ ] `customers` object — if the default name list isn't right, supply region-keyed arrays (e.g. `US: ['Sarah from Dallas']`) matched to the campaign's target market
- [ ] Timing values reviewed: `initialDelay`, `displayDuration`, `delayBetween` — adjust if the defaults don't suit the page length or flow
- [ ] `maxMobileShows` reviewed — default is 5; lower it if mobile experience feels intrusive

### Configuring the exit intent popup

- [ ] Decide on approach: **image-only** (`initExitIntentImage`) or **template** (`initExitIntentTemplate`) — choose one and remove the other
- [ ] The chosen `initExitIntent*` call is inside the `next:initialized` event handler in the checkout JS file
- [ ] **If using image-only:** replace `placehold.co` URL with the real campaign-specific image URL
- [ ] **If using image-only:** confirm the `action` callback is correct — typically `await next.applyCoupon('CODE')`
- [ ] **If using template:** `exit-intent-popup.html` partial exists in `_includes/` and is included in the checkout page via `{% campaign_include 'exit-intent-popup.html' %}`
- [ ] **If using template:** `css/exit-intent-popup.css` is listed in `styles:` in the checkout page frontmatter
- [ ] **If using template:** `popup_image` arg is set to the real campaign image URL — not the placeholder
- [ ] **If using template:** `coupon_code` arg matches the discount code configured in `config.js` `discounts` block (or the store backend)
- [ ] **If using template:** copy/offer text (`headline`, `subheadline`, `offer_title`, `offer_label`, `offer_detail`, `cta_label`) reviewed and updated to match campaign messaging
- [ ] **If using profiles for dynamic pricing:** `profiles` block in `config.js` is uncommented and the profile name matches what the exit intent logic references

### Configuring the promo banner and timer

- [ ] `promo-banner.js` and `promo-timer.js` added to `scripts:` in page frontmatter
- [ ] `promo_sale: "default"` set in frontmatter (or a specific sale name to force a promotion year-round)
- [ ] `<promo-banner>` placed at the top of the page inside `<div data-next-hide="param.banner=='n'" class="section_header">`
- [ ] `<promo-timer>` placed above `<div class="checkout-form">` in the checkout left column
- [ ] Both components wired with `{% if promo_sale %} force-sale="{{ promo_sale }}"{% endif %}`
- [ ] To hide the banner top bar, add `promo_topbar: "false"` to frontmatter and wire with `{% if promo_topbar %} show-topbar="{{ promo_topbar }}"{% endif %}`
- [ ] To edit sale dates or promo codes, update the `sales` array in both `promo-banner.js` and `promo-timer.js` — keep them in sync

Available sale names: `newyear` · `valentinesday` · `stpatricks` · `easter` · `mothersday` · `memorialday` · `fathersday` · `4thofjuly` · `summersale` · `backtoschool` · `halloween` · `veteransday` · `blackfriday` · `cybermonday` · `xmas` · `yearend`

---

### Debugging — SDK not working

- [ ] Run `window.next.version` in browser console — if undefined, the SDK failed to load
- [ ] Check `sdk_version` in `campaigns.json` is a valid version string (e.g. `"0.4.6"`), not `"latest"`
- [ ] Check browser console for 404 on the SDK CDN script or `config.js`
- [ ] Confirm `config.js` loads before the SDK in rendered `<head>` source
- [ ] Confirm `apiKey` in `config.js` is correct for this campaign
- [ ] Inspect rendered HTML — verify `<meta name="next-page-type">` and URL meta tags are present with correct values
- [ ] Check all `data-next-package-id` values match real package IDs in the Campaigns App — wrong IDs produce no output silently
- [ ] For form submission issues: check DevTools → Network for 4xx API responses
- [ ] For display not updating: confirm the element has a valid `data-next-display` token and the SDK is loaded

---

## Custom analytics events

The SDK fires standard ecommerce events automatically (`view_item`, `add_to_cart`, `begin_checkout`, `purchase`). For custom events beyond these, use the programmatic API.

### Firing a custom event

```js
// Available after SDK initializes
window.next.track('custom_event_name', {
  key: 'value'
});
```

### Analytics mode

Set in `config.js`:

```js
analytics: {
  enabled: true,
  mode: 'auto',     // 'auto' — SDK fires all standard events automatically
                    // 'manual' — SDK fires nothing; you call window.next.track() yourself
                    // 'disabled' — no analytics at all
  providers: { ... }
}
```

Use `'manual'` if you need full control over when and what gets tracked (e.g. custom funnel steps, conditional events).

### Checking analytics status (debug)

```js
window.nextDebug.analytics.getStatus()              // shows enabled providers + recent events
window.nextDebug.analytics.track('test_event', {})  // test fire
```

---

## Programmatic SDK API (`window.next`)

Available after the SDK initializes. Use this for custom JS interactions — not to replicate what data attributes already handle.

```js
// Cart
window.next.cart.getState()            // current cart state
window.next.cart.addPackage(id, qty)   // add a package programmatically
window.next.cart.clear()               // empty the cart

// Analytics
window.next.track('event_name', data)  // fire a custom analytics event

// SDK info
window.next.version                    // SDK version string
window.next.ready(callback)            // run callback once SDK is initialized
```

For anything cart/checkout/upsell related, prefer data attributes over calling the API directly — they are more declarative and easier to maintain.

---

## Debug utilities (`window.nextDebug`)

Enable debug mode via URL parameter or meta tag:

```html
<!-- in base.html or the page -->
<meta name="next-debug" content="true">
```

Or append `?debugger=true` to the page URL.

Available utilities in browser console:

```js
// Inspect state
window.nextDebug.stores.cart.getState()       // cart store state
window.nextDebug.stores.campaign.getState()   // campaign data
window.nextDebug.stores.order.getState()      // order state
window.nextDebug.stores.checkout.getState()   // checkout form state

// Analytics
window.nextDebug.analytics.getStatus()        // provider status + event log
window.nextDebug.analytics.track('evt', {})   // test fire an event

// Other
window.nextDebug.overlay()                    // show debug overlay panel
window.nextDebug.reinitialize()               // re-run SDK initialization
```

If `window.nextDebug` is undefined, debug mode is not enabled — add the meta tag or URL parameter.

---

## Rules

1. **Use `campaign_asset` for all local asset paths.** Never write hardcoded relative paths like `../../css/checkout.css`.
2. **Use `campaign_link` for all inter-page URLs.** Never hardcode `/slug/page/` paths.
3. **Only use documented `data-next-*` attributes.** Do not invent attribute names.
4. **Do not write JavaScript that duplicates SDK behaviour.** The SDK handles cart state, field binding, form submission, upsell accept/decline, and dynamic display. Write JS only for UI behaviour the SDK doesn't cover (e.g. Swiper sliders, modals, custom animations).
5. **page_type must match the page's role.** `checkout` for payment collection, `upsell` for post-purchase offers, `receipt` for order confirmation. The SDK behaves differently on each.
6. **Keep each campaign self-contained.** Do not reference assets from another campaign's directory.
7. **`config.js` must load before the SDK.** This is already handled by `base.html` — do not reorder these script tags.
8. **SDK version is set in campaigns.json**, not in `base.html` directly. To upgrade, update `sdk_version` in the campaign's entry.
9. **`next_url`, `next_url`, `decline_url` are filenames** (e.g. `upsell.html`) — `base.html` applies `campaign_link` to them. Do not pre-format these values in frontmatter.
10. **Inside `<template>` elements, use single-brace tokens** (`{item.name}`), not Liquid (`{{ item.name }}`).
