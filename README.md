# Campaign Cart Starter Templates

Starter templates for building sales funnel pages — checkout, post-purchase upsells, and order confirmation — using **[next-campaign-page-kit](https://github.com/NextCommerceCo/next-campaign-page-kit)** and the [Campaign Cart SDK](https://developers.nextcommerce.com/docs/campaigns/campaign-cart/) by NextCommerce.

## What's in this repo

This repository is the active **0.4.x starter templates** project for [next-campaign-page-kit](https://github.com/NextCommerceCo/next-campaign-page-kit).

---

## Getting started

### Start here (recommended)

Clone this repo and run the templates as-is.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NextCommerceCo/campaign-cart-starter-templates.git
cd campaign-cart-starter-templates
npm install
npm run dev
```

Pick a campaign from the interactive prompt. The dev server will hot-reload as you edit.

When you're ready to build your own variant:

```bash
npm run clone
```

You'll be prompted to:

1. Select a source campaign (for example `olympus`)
2. Enter a new slug (for example `my-campaign`)

`npm run clone` copies the campaign folder and creates a new campaign entry in `_data/campaigns.json`.

Then run:

```bash
npm run config
npm run dev
```

Before shipping, update your new campaign's store fields, package IDs, and any template copy/images.

### Adding a template to an existing project

**Step 1 — Initialize your project** (if needed)

```bash
mkdir my-campaigns && cd my-campaigns
npm init -y
npm install next-campaign-page-kit
npx campaign-init
```

This creates `_data/campaigns.json` and the core npm scripts.

**Step 2 — Copy a starter template**

Use either:
- an existing starter template (for example `olympus`), or
- a campaign variant you created with `npm run clone`.

Then copy it into your project `src/` as your slug:

```bash
# from your project root
cp -r /path/to/campaign-cart-starter-templates/src/olympus src/my-campaign
```

`my-campaign` is your URL slug (example: `/my-campaign/checkout/`).

**Step 3 — Add the campaign entry**

Copy the matching object from `/path/to/campaign-cart-starter-templates/_data/campaigns.json` into your project's `_data/campaigns.json`.

At minimum, make sure this exists and is updated:

```json
{
  "my-campaign": {
    "name": "My Campaign",
    "description": "Campaign description",
    "sdk_version": "0.4.18",
    "store_name": "Your Store",
    "store_url": "https://your-store.com/",
    "store_terms": "https://your-store.com/terms",
    "store_privacy": "https://your-store.com/privacy",
    "store_contact": "https://your-store.com/contact",
    "store_returns": "https://your-store.com/returns",
    "store_shipping": "https://your-store.com/shipping",
    "store_phone": "1 (800) 000-0000",
    "store_phone_tel": "tel:+18000000000",
    "gtm_id": "",
    "fb_pixel_id": ""
  }
}
```

**Step 4 — Set your API key**

```bash
npm run config
```

This writes your [Campaigns App API key](https://developers.nextcommerce.com/docs/campaigns/campaign-cart/) into `src/[slug]/assets/config.js`.

**Step 5 — Start developing**

```bash
npm run dev
```

> **To create a variant:** run `npm run clone` — it copies an existing campaign to a new slug and updates `campaigns.json` automatically.

**Pre-checkout pages (landing + presell)**

`olympus` includes a full presell → landing → checkout funnel. The `landing` slug is the composable section library — browse `landing/index` to see every section, then copy the `_includes/` files you want into your own slug. See [docs/pre-checkout-pages.md](docs/pre-checkout-pages.md) for usage details.

| Template | Description | Preview |
|----------|-------------|---------|

| `olympus` · landing | Supplement sleep landing page | [preview](https://nextcommerce-campaign-templates.netlify.app/olympus/landing/) |
| `landing` | Full section showcase (every component) | [preview](https://nextcommerce-campaign-templates.netlify.app/landing/index/) |

## npm scripts

Run these inside the repository root:

```bash
npm run dev        # interactive campaign picker + dev server
npm run build      # build all campaigns to _site/
npm run clone      # fastest way to create your own campaign from an existing template
npm run compress   # optimise images
npm run config     # set Campaigns App API keys
```

---

## Deploy your campaign

See [docs/campaign-page-kit-template-context.md](docs/campaign-page-kit-template-context.md) for deployment instructions covering Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, and generic static hosting.

---

## AI development rules

Copy [docs/campaign-page-kit-template-context.md](docs/campaign-page-kit-template-context.md) into your project root as `CLAUDE.md` before using an AI assistant to build or modify templates.

```bash
cp campaign-cart-starter-templates/docs/campaign-page-kit-template-context.md your-project/CLAUDE.md
```

This gives your AI assistant the context it needs to work correctly with Campaign Cart templates — project structure, Liquid filters, SDK attributes, config, and task checklists. Without it, the assistant will not know the correct SDK version, required `campaigns.json` fields, or how to use `campaign_asset` / `campaign_link` / `campaign_include`.

Pre-checkout **landing** and **presell** deep dive (Tailwind production build, same-slug presell, CTAs): [docs/pre-checkout-pages.md](docs/pre-checkout-pages.md).

For other AI tools: Cursor loads rules from `.cursor/rules/`, Windsurf from `.windsurfrules`. The file content works for all of them — only the filename/location differs.
